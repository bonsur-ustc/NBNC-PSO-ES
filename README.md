# NBNC-PSO-ES
This is an source code of NBNC-PSO-ES in MATLAB <br> 

This program includes the algorithms and test suit on CEC2013. Based on this, you can easily compare it with other algorithms as well as update it. This project is totally for research purpose.<br>

NBNC-PSO-ES has three basic components: algorithm, function_code and data. Algorithm is the main part for NBNC-PSO-ES and the program entry is 'ex.m'. The function_code contains several supplement tools for test problems and the data contains information about the optimal value  from CEC2013.<br>
